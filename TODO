Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA)
===============================
Basic operation; when armed the ILA is sampling to its BRAM continuously, once
triggered it will store an additional R_POST_TRIG_SAMPLES to its BRAM. This
allows for arbitrary number of samples to be recorded pre-trigger condition.

The total depth of the BRAM could be probed by writing all-ones to
R_POST_TRIG_SAMPLES and then read back adding a one (as non-implemented bits
will always read as zero).


Low-res overlay graphics
========================
Maybe half or one forth of the native resolution. Single port BRAM, SPI
has read/write and video has read only. From the point where SPI presents the address
the timing is quite lax until data need to be ready/consumed. Video can have
priority and SPI will make its access in one of the available slots.
